# 3.3 - Do While

###### ICS3U - Mr. Jamieson üê†

Before we begin, let's cover the `isNaN()` function. It has been mentioned in passing but here's how it works:

- `isNaN(value)` will return `true` if the `value` _**is not a number**_.
- It will return `false` if the `value` _is_ a number.

**Example:**
```JS
let user_choice = parseInt(prompt("Please enter a number: "));

if (isNaN(user_choice)) {
  console.log("Sorry, that entry was not a valid number.");
}
```

### Recall the While Loop:

The _While_ loop might _never_ run...
```JS
let raining = false;

while (raining) {
  console.log("It's raining, I need an umbrella.");
}

// The loop above will not run. Not even once.
```
Sometimes we _want_ the loop to run _at least once_. For example, when getting input from the user.<br>That's where the **[do...while loop](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_dowhile.asp)** can help:
```JS
let input;

do {
  input = parseInt(prompt("Please enter a number from 1 to 5"));
} while ((isNaN(input)) || (input < 1) || (input > 5));

// The loop above will run at least once
```

- Notice that the _condition_ is at the _end_ of the code block for a **[do...while](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_dowhile.asp)**. Conversely, the [while](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_while.asp) loop has the condition _at the beginning_.

> It is up to the _developer_ to pick the correct loop. Sometimes a _while_ is better, sometimes a _do while_ is better... 

**Here's another example:**
```JS
let raining = false;

do {
  console.log("It's raining! I need an umbrella.");
} while (raining);
```
### ‚ùì What might be wrong with that example above?

# More Examples
Sometimes you need to use a 'counter' to control the loop. Remember to always *modify* the counter each loop to avoid an infinite scenario!
```JS
// Print "Hi" the given number of times (at least once)
function printHi(num) {
  do  {
    console.log("Hi");
    num--;  // OR num = num - 1
  } while (num > 0);
}
```
Other times you might use a random number, a string, or input to control the loop:
```JS
// Ask the user for a number and validate their input
function getNumber() {
  let input;
  do {
    input = Number(prompt("Please enter a number:"));
  } while (isNaN(input));

  return input;
}
```

We can _**build**_ complicated mathematics or strings using a loop:
```JS
// Build a string from user input
function build_string() {
  let output = "";
  let input;
  do {
    input = prompt("Enter a string or 'q' to quit: ");
    output += input;
  
  } while (input.toLowerCase() != "q")

  return output;
}
```
### ü§î
- Why are the variables `input` and `output` declared outside of the loop?
- Can you think of a potential problem or small bug with the `build_string()` function?

Now it's your turn to practice. The list of functions below is in _no particular order_. Pick what you want to work on based on your own abilities. Having difficulty? There are so many ways to get help!

Create a new code file for yourself, called `3.3 - Do While.js`.

### `negativeOnly()`
Write the function `negativeOnly()` that asks the user for _a negative number_ and _keeps asking for one_ as long as they enter something _other_ than a negative value. If a negative number is entered, the function ends.

### `printOdd(n)`
Given some number, `n`, as a parameter to the function, print the _odd_ numbers from 1 to `n`. If `n` is less than 1 or _not a number_, nothing should print. <br>**For Example:**
```JS
printOdd(7);
// Prints:
1
3
5
7

printOdd("s'up?");
// Nothing is printed
```

### `parrotUntilQuit()`

Prompt the user to enter some text or the word 'quit'.
  - If the input is not _**quit**_ print it back out to them and then prompt them again.
  - If the input _is **quit**,_ print "Goodbye!" to the screen and the program ends.

### `factorial(n)`
In mathematics, the *factorial* of a number is written like this:<br> n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x (n-3) x ... x 2 x 1

For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

Write the function `factorial(n)` that calculates and *returns* the factorial of the given number.
<br>**For Example:**
  ```JS
  factorial(5);
  120
  factorial(3);
  6
  factorial(10);
  3628800
  ```

Fun fact: you can only take the factorial of positive whole values and `0! == 1`.
