## Brief Recap of Strings
A single letter is called a character (`char`).

Each character is a symbol (drawing) tracked by a number in the computers' memory. The computer looks-up the symbol, based on that number.
- [ASCII Characters](https://ss64.com/ascii.html)
- [Unicode Characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters)

Many characters together is called a `String` of characters. Like a string of Christmas lights.
- Ex: The word hello is a string made of the chars 'h' 'e' 'l' 'l' 'o'.
- The first letter (`char`) is at position zero.
- A `char` is _primitive_. They're very boring. Not much we can do with them.
- A `String` is an _object_. Lots of neat _properties_ and _functions_ are available to them.
  - Strings have a very important _property_:  `.length` which gives the number of _all_ characters in the String.
- It is very important to remember that "a" and "A" are considered different. `"Hello" != "hello"`
- **Note**: JavaScript treats single letters as a String, not a char.
 
We can "build" a `String` using the _concatonate_ feature of the `+` operator:
```JS
let my_output = "";
let t = "third";

my_output += "First" + " " + "second" + t;

return my_output;    // returns "First secondthird"
```

That will become very handy later.

## New Information

A _property_ is a fact about an object.
- _Strings_ have a very important property that we've seen before: `.length`
  ```JS
  let myString = "Hello World!";
  console.log(myString.length);   // Prints 12 to the screen
  ```

A _function_ - also known as a _method_ - is something that an object can _do_ to manipulate data or give a result.

- Strings have [lots of useful functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp) but the ones we might focus on are:
<br>`.charAt()`
<br>`.toUpperCase()` and `.toLowerCase()`
<br>`.charCodeAt()`
<br>`.substring()` 
<br>and _many more_, with [awesome examples at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp)!

- Another very useful tool is the ability to get a _character_ based on its [code (number)](https://ss64.com/ascii.html). For that we use `String.fromCharCode()` and give the Unicode number.
  ```JS
  let my_char = String.fromCharCode(64);   // the @ character
  console.log(my_char);  // @
  ```

## Examples
**Don't forget! To get a single character from the string we can use `.charAt(index)` or the shortcut of `[index]`.**

Now that we know a loop, we can loop through a string and print one character at a time!
```JS
let longText = "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious";
let current_letter = 0;

while (current_letter < longText.length) {
  console.log(longText[current_letter]);
  current_letter++;
}
```

We can also _**build**_ a String, if necessary:

**Simple Example:**
```js
// duplicate the string as many times as requested
function duplicate(str, number_of_times) {
  let output = "";    // Empty string for building
  let n = 1;

  while (n <= number_of_times) {
    output += str;
  }

  return output;
}

// What will repeated_string be?
let repeated_string = duplicate("Yay Code!", 100);
```

**More Complicated Example:**
```JS
// Build a new string that does not have any spaces
let output = "";
let sample_text = "This is a sentence with spaces";
let n = 0;

while (n < sample_text.length) {
  // The character code for a space is 32
  if (sample_text.charCodeAt(n) != 32) {
    // Replace "with" with "without" and skip ahead the appropriate amount
    if (sample_text[n] == "w") {
      output += "without";
      n += 3; // Skip past "with"
    } else {
      output += sample_text[n];
    }
  }
  // Make sure we go ahead one character
  n++;
}

console.log(output);    // Thisisasentencewithoutspaces
```

## Your Task

Inside your `Unit 3` folder, make a new code file called `3.2 - Strings.js` 

Try creating the following functions:
- `reverse(str)` _Print_ the reverse of the given string to the console.
  <br>Examples:
  ```JS
  reverse("Hello");
  "olleH"
  reverse("Coding's great!");
  "!taerg s'gnidoC"
  ```
  
- `dragons_and_goblins(str)`
  For this function a string of random letters is passed in (for example `dragons_and_goblins("dbhfghfgdbchdnwjdg")`). Your job is to count how many dragons ("d") and goblins ("g") are encountered. _Print_ the result to the console as shown in the examples below:
  ```JS
  dragons_and_goblins("dbhfghfgdbchdnwjdg");
  "Dragons: 4 Goblins: 3"
  dragons_and_goblins("pgoggl45j6ng jk*&j3 h^gg%h");
  "Dragons: 0 Goblins: 6"
  ```

- `add(str)` You will be given a string of _all_ single-digit numbers. Add them up and _return_ the result.
  <br>Examples:
  ```JS
  console.log(add("9350701"));
  25
  console.log(add("11111111112222255"));
  30
  ```
- `add_subtract(str)` The same as the `add()` function _except_ if you encounter a "-" symbol, the next number is _subtracted_ from the total. _Return_ the result.
  <br>Example:
  ```JS
  console.log(add_subtract("543-36-9"));
  6
  console.log(add_subtract("0-102-53-3-1-5"));
  -10
  ```
